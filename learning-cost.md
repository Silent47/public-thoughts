Search resources of knowledge  
Collect materials of knowledge  
Understand knowledge  
Practice knowledge  
Working with knowledge

The progress costs too much time horribly  
If knowledge can be made to be plugins  
no matter in software form or hardware  
Regardless of Internet searching or market purchasing  
Plug and play  
The time cost of learning will be almost zero
